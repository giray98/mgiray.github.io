<p>PhD Candidate, Electrical Engineering, Stanford University</p>
<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>I am a PhD candidate in electrical engineering at Stanford University,
  and member of <a href="https://github.com/cvxgrp">convex optimization group</a>
  advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/">Prof. Stephen Boyd</a>.
  My research is supported by U.S. Department of Energy
  as part of Renewable Energy Generator Risk under Outlier Weather (REGROW) project.
  I collaborate with SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory
  <a href="https://gismo.slac.stanford.edu">GISMO</a> group and 
  work closely with <a href="https://bmeyers.github.io/about/">Dr. Bennet Meyers</a>.
  I completed my bachelors in electrical engineering 
  at <a href="https://bogazici.edu.tr/en-US/Index">Boğaziçi University</a> in Istanbul.
  I am originally from Ankara, Turkey.</p>
<p>My expected graduation date is June 2025.</p>

<h1 id="research">Research</h1>
<p> 
  My research is on developing convex optimization methods to
  integrate renewable energy resources such as solar energy into the power grid.
  Current paradigm of power grid operation is not fully designed to handle the
  variability and uncertainty of renewable energy resources 
  (e.g. <a href="https://www.caiso.com/Documents/Final-Root-Cause-Analysis-Mid-August-2020-Extreme-Heat-Wave.pdf">rotating outages in California on August 2020</a>).
  I am interested in developing explainable machine learning models
  to do probabilistic forecasting of renewable energy resources
  and then design robust optimization methods to integrate these forecasts
  into the power grid operation.
  I try to make sure that methods I develop are explainable and interpretable
  so that they can be safely used in practice. To achieve this goal,
  I use tools from convex optimization, machine learning, and statistics.

                <p>
                  We present a novel method for modeling time-dependent statistics in the power signal generated by a photovoltaic (PV) system. 
                  Our white-box machine learning method is interpretable and auditable, based on principles of multiperiodic basis functions 
                  and convex optimization. Our proposed method of time dilating the daily signal to remove night time values results in a 
                  novel representation of PV power signals, evocative of a `Bundt cake'. 
                  The proposed model describes the marginal distribution of power output as a function of date and time. 
                  The resulting probabilistic model of a PV system can be used to perform a variety of tasks, and here, 
                  we demonstrate the application of clear sky detection.

                <p>
                  We consider the problem of forecasting net load over a horizon such as one day, using a trailing window of past net load values 
                  as well as date and time. We focus on three variations on this problem: point forecasts, marginal quantile forecasts, 
                  and generating conditional samples of the future value. 
                  We propose a method that relies on linear regression using some custom engineered 
                  time-based features to capture multiple periodicities, such as daily, weekly, and seasonal, 
                  and their interactions. Our proposed models are readily interpretable, and rely on efficient 
                  and reliable convex optimization to fit. We illustrate our method on four years worth of hourly net load data, 
                  comparing predictions made with various subsets of the features.

                <p>
                  We present a novel method for fitting a smooth periodic stochastic process to PV power generation data using Gaussian copulas and
                  convex optimization. Our method handles many aspects of the data such as seasonal variation 
                  in the distribution of power output, dependencies among different PV systems, 
                  and dependencies across time. 
                  It consists of statistically interpretable steps and is scalable to thousands of systems. 
                  Our method can generate synthetic data, detect anomalies, impute missing data and make forecasts. 
                  It is well suited for heterogenous data sets, e.g., combining power generation with weather data 
                  or even real-time energy prices.

              <p>
                We consider the well-studied problem of predicting the time-varying covariance matrix of a vector of financial returns. 
                Popular methods range from simple predictors like rolling window or exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) 
                to more sophisticated predictors such as generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) type methods. 
                Building on a specific covariance estimator suggested by Engle in 2002, we propose a relatively simple extension 
                that requires little or no tuning or fitting, is interpretable, and produces results at least as good as MGARCH, 
                a popular extension of GARCH that handles multiple assets. To evaluate predictors we introduce a novel approach, 
                evaluating the regret of the log-likelihood over a time period such as a quarter. 
                This metric allows us to see not only how well a covariance predictor does over all, 
                but also how quickly it reacts to changes in market conditions. 
                Our simple predictor outperforms MGARCH in terms of regret. 
                We also test covariance predictors on downstream applications such as portfolio optimization 
                methods that depend on the covariance matrix. For these applications our simple covariance 
                predictor and MGARCH perform similarly.
